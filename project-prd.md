# üß© Barber Shop Management System ‚Äì Combined Product Requirements Document (PRD)

**Phase:** UI + Frontend Logic (Dummy Data)

## 3. Shared Design & Theme

- **Light Mode Only**

  card:      '#FFFFFF',
  text:      '#111111',
  muted:     '#555555',
  border:    '#E5E5E5',
  accent:    '#1E1E1E',
  success:   '#059669',
  warning:   '#D97706',
  error:     '#DC2626',
};
````
