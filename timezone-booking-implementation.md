# Timezone Handling Implementation for Booking System

## Overview
We've implemented proper timezone handling for the booking system to ensure accurate calculation of time slots and prevent booking conflicts across different timezones. This is crucial for a booking system where clients may be in different timezones than the business.

## Backend Changes

### 1. Appointment Utilities (`appointment.utils.js`)
- Added a new `convertTimezone` function to convert times between local and UTC timezones
- Updated the `generateTimeSlots` function to include timezone information in the generated slots
- Added timezone offset information to each slot for client-side timezone conversion

### 2. Public Booking Controller (`publicBooking.controller.js`)
- Updated the `getBookingSlots` endpoint to accept a `timezone` parameter from the client
- Modified the endpoint to filter out past slots based on the current time in the client's timezone
- Added timezone information to the response
- Updated the `createBooking` endpoint to handle timezone conversion when creating appointments
- Added timezone conversion when sending the response back to the client

## Frontend Changes

### 1. Booking Service (`bookingService.ts`)
- Updated the `BookingSlot` interface to include timezone information
- Modified the `BookingRequest` interface to include timezone information
- Updated the `getBookingSlots` function to send the client's timezone to the server
- Updated the `createBooking` function to include the client's timezone in the request

### 2. DateTimeSelection Component (`DateTimeSelection.tsx`)
- Added display of the client's timezone
- Added a helper function to format time displays consistently
- Updated the time slot display to show both start and end times in tooltips

### 3. BookingConfirmation Component (`BookingConfirmation.tsx`)
- Added display of timezone information in the booking confirmation
- Updated the booking request to include the client's timezone
- Added storage of the booking timezone from the server response

## Benefits
1. **Accurate Time Slot Calculation**: Time slots are now calculated correctly regardless of the client's timezone
2. **Prevent Double Bookings**: By handling timezone conversions on the server, we prevent double bookings that could occur due to timezone differences
3. **Improved User Experience**: Users now see their local timezone and times are displayed correctly
4. **Consistent Data Storage**: All appointments are stored in a consistent timezone on the server

## Future Improvements
1. **Multiple Service Bookings**: Extend the implementation to handle multiple services in a single booking
2. **Timezone Selection**: Allow users to manually select their timezone if needed
3. **Calendar Integration**: Add calendar integration with proper timezone handling for calendar invites
