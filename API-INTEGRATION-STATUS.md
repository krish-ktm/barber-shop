# Barber Shop API Integration Status

## Overview

This document provides an overview of the API integration progress for the Barber Shop Management application. The integration replaces the mock data with API calls to fetch and manage data.

## Completed Integrations

The following pages have been fully integrated with the API:

1. **Services Page**
   - Fetches services from the API
   - Adds/edits/deletes services through API calls
   - Includes loading states and error handling

2. **Customers Page**
   - Fetches customers from the API
   - Adds/edits customers through API calls
   - Shows customer invoices from the API
   - Includes loading states, error handling, and filtering

3. **Staff Management Page**
   - Fetches staff members from the API
   - Adds/edits/deletes staff through API calls
   - Includes loading states, error handling, and filtering

4. **Dashboard Page**
   - Fetches dashboard statistics from the API
   - Displays real-time revenue and performance data
   - Shows top services and staff performance metrics
   - Includes loading states and error handling for all data sections

5. **Appointments Page**
   - Fetches appointments from the API
   - Filters appointments by date, staff, and service
   - Includes loading states and comprehensive error handling
   - Supports full appointment management lifecycle

6. **Settings Page**
   - Loads business settings from the API
   - Saves updated settings through API calls
   - Handles loading states and validation
   - Includes error handling with user feedback

7. **Reports Page**
   - Fetches report data based on selected filters
   - Supports date range selection and comparison options
   - Includes loading indicators for each data section
   - Displays staff and service performance metrics from API

8. **GST Settings Page**
   - Loads GST rates configuration from the API
   - Supports adding, editing, and deleting GST rates
   - Handles components within each GST rate
   - Includes loading states and validation with error handling

## Integration Pattern

For each page, the following pattern has been implemented:

1. **API Hooks Setup**
   ```typescript
   const {
     data: someData,
     loading: isLoading,
     error: someError,
     execute: fetchSomeData
   } = useApi(apiFunction);
   ```

2. **Initial Data Loading**
   ```typescript
   useEffect(() => {
     fetchSomeData();
   }, [fetchSomeData]);
   ```

3. **Error Handling**
   ```typescript
   useEffect(() => {
     if (someError) {
       toast({
         title: 'Error',
         description: someError.message,
         variant: 'destructive',
       });
     }
   }, [someError, toast]);
   ```

4. **Loading States**
   ```tsx
   {isLoading ? (
     <div className="flex justify-center items-center p-12">
       <Loader2 className="h-8 w-8 animate-spin text-muted-foreground" />
       <span className="ml-3">Loading data...</span>
     </div>
   ) : (
     // Render data
   )}
   ```

5. **Dialog Components**
   - Updated to accept callbacks for API operations (onSave, onUpdate, onDelete)
   - Changed from direct toast messages to callback patterns

## API Integration Completed

All pages in the application have been successfully integrated with the API. The integration follows consistent patterns for:

- Data fetching and state management
- Loading indicators and error handling
- Type conversion between API and UI models
- Form validation and submission
- Toast notifications for user feedback

## Type Conversion Patterns

When the API types differ from frontend types, create mapping functions:

```typescript
// Convert API data to internal format
const mapApiDataToInternal = (apiData: ApiType): InternalType => {
  return {
    // Map properties accordingly
  };
};

// Convert internal data to API format for updates
const mapInternalDataToApi = (internalData: InternalType): ApiType => {
  return {
    // Map properties accordingly
  };
};
```

## Notes on API Error Handling

The API client (apiClient.ts) handles common errors like:
- Authentication failures (redirects to login)
- Network errors
- Server errors

Component-level error handling should focus on:
- Displaying user-friendly messages for specific errors
- Graceful fallbacks when data is unavailable
- Retry mechanisms where appropriate

## Testing without API

During development or when the API is unavailable, you can:
1. Temporarily revert to mock data
2. Implement fallback mechanisms in API services
3. Create a mock API server using tools like MSW
